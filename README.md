# conjure-python-client

## Local development

A light-weight HTTP client library.

### Overview

conjure-typescript-client leverages [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) to provide a simple interface for making HTTP requests. conjure-python-client was designed to handle the RPC layer for clients generated by [conjure-python](https://github.com/palantir/conjure-python).
